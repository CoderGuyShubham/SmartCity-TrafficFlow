# Intelligent Traffic Signal Controller using OpenCV


## Description

This project focuses on creating an Intelligent Traffic Signal Controller (ITSC) using the open-source computer vision library OpenCV. It processes video feeds from cameras to identify vehicles and traffic lights, monitor their movement, and automatically adjust signal timings in real time to enhance traffic flow and improve safety at intersections.

## Components

* **Vehicle Detection:** Utilize techniques like contour analysis, object detection models, or a combination to identify and track vehicles in motion.
* **Traffic Light Detection:** Employ color thresholding, image segmentation, or pre-trained models to recognize and classify traffic light states (red, yellow, green).
* **Traffic Analysis:** Calculate metrics like traffic density, queue length, and average speed for each lane to understand traffic flow patterns.
* **Signal Timing Algorithm:** Develop an algorithm that uses traffic data and predefined rules to adjust signal timings in real-time, considering fairness, safety, and efficiency.

## Implementation

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Core Library:** OpenCV
* **Additional Libraries:** May be needed for hardware interfacing, data analysis, and visualization

## Testing and Evaluation

* **Simulated Environment:** Using synthetic or recorded video data
* **Performance Metrics:** Traffic flow improvement, signal change frequency, queue reduction
* **Real-World Testing:** Controlled settings, safety measures, and regulatory approvals

## Further Development

* **Vehicle Classification:** Prioritize emergency vehicles or public transport
* **Pedestrian Detection:** Implement crossing signal control
* **Advanced Machine Learning:** Improved accuracy and adaptability

## Note

This is a simplified example. A real-world ITSC deployment requires extensive planning, engineering expertise, adherence to safety regulations, and collaboration with relevant authorities.
